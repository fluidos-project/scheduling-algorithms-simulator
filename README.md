# Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

This project provides a way to test different scheduling algorithms that can be later developed into the model based Meta-Orchestrator of the FLUIDOS project.

The project is yet very simple and only provides a way to test different spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal algorithms that aims to reduce the carbon footprint of each pod by scheduling them on specific time and location, where and when electricity grid is greener.

## Folder structure

- `algorithms/`: Contains the scheduling algorithms.
- `models/`: Contains the models used by the algorithms (nodes, pods, timeslots...).
- `views/`: Contains the views used to display the results of the algorithms.
